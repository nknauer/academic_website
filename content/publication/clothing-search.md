abstract = "With the need to properly organize OpenMart and understand future demands, the board was hoping to obtain some information regarding the forecasting of one of their items and the buying patterns of its customers. In this case, the item being analyzed was cereal (Item 5). The ultimate goal was to determine whom to advertise cereal to as well as to discovering trends in sales to determine which is the best season to stock cereal at OpenMart. The data received from OpenMart contained the transaction and demographic details regarding each purchase during a two-year time span of all their customers. Some of the methodologies used in this analysis were hierarchal clustering, exponential smoothing, and forecasting. This was my first ever project in R as an undergraduate student."
