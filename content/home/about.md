# About Me

I provide consulting in R, specifically in marketing analytics. The consulting services can range from someone who has never used R before to someone is looking to utilize R for strategy in the marketing space. 
I am currently a Senior Analyst on the Performance Marketing team at Disney Streaming Services. My role is to help with with the attribution aspect of the business specifically with ESPN+ and Disney+.   

I worked previously for companies such as Publicis Media and Optimatic Media (acq. by Matomy in 2015)

At Penn State, I was a member of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and Analytics ran by Dr. Soundar Kumara for 2 years at Penn State. I worked on cluster analysis on consumers in retail using R. I also worked with a Ph.D student on social network analysis on chemotherapy data for his thesis.

I am happy to help out where I can.
