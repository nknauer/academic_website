# About Me

I am currently the Senior Analyst in the Advanced Analytics department at Zenith Media within Publicis Media. At Publicis Media, I have worked on projects pertaining to optimal frequency, media mix modeling, market basket analysis, optimal sample size selection for A/B Testing, and automation of reporting in R across multiple partners. 

Along with working at Publicis, I provide consulting for R-training. 

Before working at Publicis, I was a member of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and Analytics ran by Dr. Soundar Kumara for 2 years at Penn State. I worked on cluster analysis on consumers in retail using R. I also worked with a Ph.D student on social network analysis on chemotherapy data for his thesis.

I then worked as a Business Analyst for a start-up AdTech company, Optimatic Media, that later was acquired by Matomy Media, an Israeli-based SSP.  

I enjoy traveling, camping, running, lifting, reading, blogging, playing poker, and spending quality time with friends & family. This platform seems like it would be a great opportunity to also post content related to the AI/Machine Learning industry in my "Posts" section. Hope everyone enjoys and feel free to reach out.
